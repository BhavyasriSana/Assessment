DOCKER
Part A
1. With minimal possible layers to install Web Services and expose appropriate http port for accessing.
Created a nodejs app and exposed a port 8080
Command to build image
“docker build –f Dockerfile –t nodejs .”
Command to run the image, we map the port with 8080 in local machine.
 “docker run –d –p 80:8080 –name nodejs  nodejs:latest”

 2. You are trying to start a Docker container and it is failing to start – what according to you are possible causes
ANS:- The possible causes are
 User does not have enough permissions to the directory.
 Port is already allocated to another service.
 Container with same name already exists.
 Not enough space on the device.
 Proxy is not setup with docker registry.
 Container build cache.
 Running too many services in the same container.
 
PART B
    1.Using shell command search for a particular pattern (of your choice) to search Docker logs 
         using awk command.                                                                                                
      ANS:-Command to search for a particular pattern
 Awk command can be used to find a particular pattern in Docker logs.
	Below command print the lines which matches with given pattern.
“docker logs test | awk '/Run/ {print}'” - (This will prints only the lines containing ‘Run’)

    2. Execute a shell command inside a container to search for a file.
    ANS:- Shell command to search for a file inside the container.
 “docker exec –it <container name> find / -name <filename>” (without opening a bash interactive terminal)
  “docker exec –it <container name> find / -name <filename> /bin/bash” (with a bash interactive terminal)

JENKINS
PART A
1. There is a Jenkins pipeline failure the failure error at the outset suggest that build has  failed and one of the tool used for the build is running inside the container – what are the commands you will use for debugging the issue
ANS:-Commands which can be used for debugging the issue
 docker logs <container_Id> (command which shows all i/p o/p and errors of the container)
docker exec -it <container_Id> /bin/bash (go inside a container and debug)
docker cp <container_Id>:/pathinserver /local-path (to save the container log locally and debug the issue)
docker commit <container_Id> my-broken-container && docker run -it my-broken-container /bin/bash
docker stats <container_Id> (when we are using any metrics, and they show how the error occured)

2. There is a build failure due to connectivity issue with one of the tools – what actions you will take to narrow down the issue.
ANS:-The actions to be taken for norrow down the issue.
Build failure analyzer to analyze the exact issue.
Need to Check whether the required plugins for the required tools are correctly installed.
Check whether the configured secret-token got expired.
In case of master-slave configuration check whether master and slave are properly configured
Check whether the apis written are properly working or not.
Checking whether the credentials are properly configured

3. As part of part of Jenkins pipeline build process assume that application is containerized and image needs to be pushed to repository, However there is a failure to indicate that image push has failed. What are the possible reasons for the failure
ANS:-Reasons for push failed
Docker pipeline plugin may not be installed.
Docker push can fail if we provide an improper secret_key/not providing any secret_key in the configuration.
In Jenkins file the stage may not be correct(syntax errors) or the proper credential name not specified.
Access denied to docker hub
Docker push halts without an error because of incorrect urls/image being timed out. For this restarting docker helps
In the Jenkins credentials, credentials might not be added properly.
Wrong tags being provided.
Directly using the login credentials, without using "with credentials".
Registry URL can be incorrect.

    4. Write a shell script to setup git repo, docker build, push image to docker repository.
Clone the shell script 
 Executable permissions needs to be given to the .sh file
Give chmod +x <filename> .
